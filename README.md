# TSP Art by Simulated Annealing

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is one of the most renowned problems in the NP-hard category. A lot of brainpower is currently being invested on research for better performing heuristics to tackle the TSP.

One such algorithm is given by the technique of Simulated Annealing (SA for short), which uses a process reminiscent of Monte Carlo procedures in order to evaluate a simil Maxwell-Boltzmann probability $e^{-\frac{E}{T}}$, where $E$ is the total length of a certain path and T is a parameter that sets how likely it is for the current path to change towards a higher length (for a more in-depth description of SA look on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).
